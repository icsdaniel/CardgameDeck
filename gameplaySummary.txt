1. Draft & Plan
• Players take turns drafting one numbered card (1–79) from a shared row. One card remains as the “rule card”.

2. Secret Selection
• With four cards in hand, everyone secretly picks one to contest the round.

3. Reveal & Resolve
• All chosen cards flip simultaneously. The leftover central card’s icon dictates which cards get discarded (most often: the highest‑value cards, including that center rule card!).
• Surviving cards become “scored” and rack up points; discarded cards are gone for good.

4. Draw, Refill & Repeat
• Discard excess, then refill the central row back to normal.
• Pass the first‑player marker and start the next round.

5. Final round
• When the hidden “80” End Card finally appears in the center, everyone gets one last draft + reveal.

This is the core of the game, balanced by the central card value pivoting players decisions and the will to push their luck.
Additionally, there's secret modifiers, extra points and set collection elements.
